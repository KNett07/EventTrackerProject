# Technologies Used
Java, SQL, MySQLWorkBench, Spring Boot, JPA, Postman

# Lessons Learned
More practice in laying foundation for a full stack application. Creating a new project, linking JPA with Boot, and mapping with Postman. This is the first installment of a growing individual project, but the lessons learned are already plenty. There are more and more moving parts to full stack development, and many of those moving parts are actually options. There are so many ways to accomplish a task, it can be overwhelming to try and choose a direction. I am learning to rely on the skills I have developed in order to lay a clear path.
